Adversarial Prompt Engineering Security Tool
Adversarial Prompt Engineering Security Tool
Overview
Welcome to the Adversarial Prompt Engineering Security Tool repository. This project was developed for the NVIDIA Generative AI Agents Contest, aiming to create a robust system that detects and mitigates adversarial prompts in AI models, thereby enhancing security and robustness. Leveraging NVIDIA's NeMo framework, TensorRT-LLM, and LangChain, this tool showcases state-of-the-art techniques in AI security.

Features
Adversarial Detection: Identifies malicious prompts that attempt to manipulate AI model outputs.
NeMo Framework: Utilizes NVIDIA's NeMo for building and training advanced conversational AI models.
LangChain Integration: Manages and orchestrates language models efficiently.
Performance Optimization: Implements NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM for optimized performance and faster inference.
Web Interface: A user-friendly web application built with Flask for easy interaction and testing.

This code is for a web application that processes text input to generate logical deductions, evaluations, and expansions using a pre-trained language model (GPT-2). It uses Flask to create a web server, which listens for incoming requests, processes them using the language model, and returns a response.

Components and Functions:
Importing Libraries:

Flask: A web framework for Python that allows you to build web applications.
GPT2Tokenizer and GPT2LMHeadModel from transformers: These are used to tokenize text and generate text using the GPT-2 language model.
openai: Library for interacting with OpenAI's API (not used in this specific script but included for potential future use).
tensorrt as trt: NVIDIA’s library for high-performance deep learning inference (not directly used in this specific script).
nemo.collections.nlp as nemo_nlp: NVIDIA’s toolkit for building NLP applications (not directly used in this specific script).
LocalLangModel and Agent from langchain: Libraries for managing language models and agents (not directly used in this specific script).
Configuration:

OPENAI_API_KEY: Sets up the API key for OpenAI services, although this script does not utilize OpenAI’s API directly.
Defining the Agent4454 Class:

This class is designed to handle the logical deduction, evaluation, and expansion of input text using two sequences: 4:4 and 5:4.
Sequences (4:4 and 5:4): These are predefined sets of instructions or steps that guide how the text should be processed.
4:4 sequence includes steps like suggesting solutions, clarifying concepts, offering practical advice, and discussing theoretical aspects.
5:4 sequence includes steps like providing simple explanations, detailed information, summaries, evidence, or balanced views.
Methods in Agent4454 Class:

__init__: Initializes the class, loads the tokenizer and the model.
logical_deduction: Processes the input text through the steps in the sequences, generating responses for each step using the language model.
evaluate: Evaluates the input text by applying the logical deduction process (simplified in this example).
expand: Expands on the input text by applying the evaluation process (simplified in this example).
process_input: Combines the deduction, evaluation, and expansion processes to handle the complete input text processing.
Setting Up the Flask Web Application:

Creating the Flask app: app = Flask(__name__)
Creating an instance of Agent4454: agent_4454 = Agent4454()
Defining the /ask Endpoint:

This endpoint listens for POST requests.
Function ask:
Retrieves the input text from the request.
Processes the input text using the agent_4454.process_input method.
Returns the processed response in JSON format.
Running the Flask App:

The app runs in debug mode, allowing you to test it locally on your machine.
Detailed Steps of What Happens When You Use the Application:
Start the Web Server:

Run the script. This starts a web server using Flask.
Send a POST Request:

You (or any client) send a POST request to the /ask endpoint with some input text.
Example: POST /ask with JSON body {"input_text": "Explain the concept of black holes."}
Process the Input:

The ask function receives the input text.
It calls agent_4454.process_input(input_text), which processes the text through logical deduction, evaluation, and expansion steps.
Generate Responses:

The logical_deduction method generates responses for each step in the sequences by:
Encoding the step prompt and input text.
Using the GPT-2 model to generate a continuation of the text.
Decoding the generated text back to a readable format.
Return the Response:

The processed text (deduction, evaluation, and expansion results) is returned as a JSON response.
Example of Interaction:
Input Text: "Explain the concept of black holes."
Logical Deduction: The text is processed through steps like suggesting solutions, clarifying concepts, offering practical advice, and discussing theoretical aspects.
Evaluation: Evaluates the input text based on the generated logical deductions.
Expansion: Further expands on the input text based on the evaluation.
Output: A JSON object containing the processed results.
This code creates an intelligent agent that can handle and respond to complex queries by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable steps, making it robust and effective for generating meaningful and contextually relevant responses.
