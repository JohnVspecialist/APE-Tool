Adversarial Prompt Engineering Security Tool
Adversarial Prompt Engineering Security Tool
Overview
Welcome to the Adversarial Prompt Engineering Security Tool repository. This project was developed for the NVIDIA Generative AI Agents Contest, aiming to create a robust system that detects and mitigates adversarial prompts in AI models, thereby enhancing security and robustness. Leveraging NVIDIA's NeMo framework, TensorRT-LLM, and LangChain, this tool showcases state-of-the-art techniques in AI security.

Features
Adversarial Detection: Identifies malicious prompts that attempt to manipulate AI model outputs.
NeMo Framework: Utilizes NVIDIA's NeMo for building and training advanced conversational AI models.
LangChain Integration: Manages and orchestrates language models efficiently.
Performance Optimization: Implements NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM for optimized performance and faster inference.
Web Interface: A user-friendly web application built with Flask for easy interaction and testing.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adversarial-prompt-engineering-security-tool.git
cd adversarial-prompt-engineering-security-tool
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers langchain tensorrt flask nemo_toolkit
Obtain and configure API keys:

NVIDIA API Key: Sign up for NVIDIAâ€™s developer program and obtain an API key.
OpenAI API Key: Sign up at OpenAI and get your API key.
Add these keys in the configuration section of your code:

python
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY
Usage
Run the Flask web application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Interact with the application:

Send a POST request to the /ask endpoint with your input text in JSON format.
Example:
json
Copy code
{
  "input_text": "Explain the concept of black holes."
}
Project Structure
app.py: Main file to run the Flask web application.
agent.py: Contains the Agent4454 class which handles logical deduction, evaluation, and expansion of input text.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
